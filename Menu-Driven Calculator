Project Overview
This project is a Menu Driven Calculator developed using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a simple text-based menu. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit.

Objectives
Build a simple calculator using Python
Understand menu-driven programming
Practice loops and conditional statements
Perform basic arithmetic operations

Tools & Technologies
Python 3
VS Code / IDLE

Project Description
The calculator displays a menu with multiple arithmetic options.
The user selects an operation, enters two numbers, and the calculator displays the result.
The program continues to execute until the user selects the Exit option.

This project is beginner-friendly and helps strengthen core Python concepts such as:
while loops
if-elif-else conditions
User input handling
Basic error checking (division by zero)

Algorithm
Display the calculator menu
Read the user’s choice
Take two numerical inputs
Perform the selected operation
Display the result
Repeat until the user exits

Features
Menu-based user interaction
Supports four arithmetic operations
Continuous execution until exit
Handles division by zero gracefully

Result
The calculator successfully performs all selected arithmetic operations and exits cleanly when prompted.

Conclusion
This mini project demonstrates fundamental Python programming concepts using a menu-driven approach. It is ideal for beginners learning control structures, loops, and basic input/output operations.
